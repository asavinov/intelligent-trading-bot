def generate_labels_highlow(df, horizon):
    """
    Generate (compute) a number of labels similar to other derived features but using future data.
    This function is used before training to generate true labels.

    We use the following conventions and dimensions for generating binary labels:
    - Threshold is used to compare all values of some parameter, for example, 0.5 or 2.0 (sign is determined from the context)
    - Greater or less than the threshold. Note that the threshold has a sign which however is determined from the context
    - High or low column to compare with the threshold. Note that relative deviations from the close are used.
      Hence, high is always positive and low is always negative.
    - horizon which determines the future window used to compute all or one
    Thus, a general label is computed via the condition: [all or one] [relative high or low] [>= or <=] threshold
    However, we do not need all combinations of parameters but rather only some of them which are grouped as follows:
    - high >= large_threshold - at least one higher than threshold: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5
    - high <= small_threshold - all lower than threshold: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4
    - low >= -small_threshold - all higher than threshold: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4
    - low <= -large_threshold - at least one lower than (negative) threshold: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5
    Accordingly, we encode the labels as follows (60 is horizon):
    - high_xx (xx is threshold): for big xx - high_xx means one is larger, for small xx - all are less
    - low_xx (xx is threshold): for big xx - low_xx means one is larger, for small xx - all are less

    If the location (index) is 0 then it is the next point. If location (index) is NaN,

    or minimum. The difference is that this function does not search for maximum but rather
    first cross of the threshold.

    Horizon specifies how many points are considered after this point and without this point.
